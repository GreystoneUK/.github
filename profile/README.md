## The Greystone story began in 1994

Starting out as a small software house and sharing the name of the founder's home. The Greystone Partnership began in 1994 by providing bespoke CRM software solutions to UK business. Expanding to incorporate Management Consulting services a few years after, then incorporated as Greystone Consulting Ltd in 2002.
Since then we have continued to grow in numbers and expertise but are proud to continue working with some of our original customers.

Our service portfolio now covers bespoke software and database development, web and eCommerce solutions, IT consultancy, support and management consulting.
